# QuickHull

This is an implementation of the QuickHull algorithm in Python. It randomly generates a set of points and finds the convex hull of this set of points using the QuickHull algorithm. More details about QuickHull algorithm here: [QuickHull](https://github.com/AnantJoshiCZ/QuickHull.git) 

# Installation/Setup

To get this code to run on your machine, you will need to follows these steps:

- Clone this repo to your local machine using 

```
git clone https://github.com/AnantJoshiCZ/QuickHull.git 
```

- Install John Zelle's graphics.py
```
pip install graphics.py
```
- Run quickhull.py
### MacOS

If you're on the MacOS, you may need to install the Tkinter dependencies separately. To do this with Homebrew, use the following:
```
brew install python-tk
```
This will install any Tkinter/tkinter dependencies and allow you to use the graphics.py library. If you do not do this step, you may see an error when running the code.
